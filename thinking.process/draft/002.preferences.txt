I like dark style.
On the welcome page can be photo on the backgound. Background examples:
    http://jchomali.com/                #backgound photo
    https://amineafia.github.io/        #interesting animations on background
    https://alexcory.com/               #interesting paralax effect

    http://antoniomarino.me/            #back photo is covered with dark smog effect or what is this?cool
Font type examples:
    https://cassidoo.co/                #type is like in terminal. Looks pretty good
    https://aditimohanty.com/           #type is ease and dont disturb eyes
Text style:
    http://www.pawar.ca/                #he writed section about him like CSS code. Looks cool.
                                        # I want this on my site. FOr example in "About me" section.
                                        # If it dont gonna be ugly, we can make whole site in this style.
                                        # Also this site feels as "infinite", however you can't scroll.
                                        # In my opinion, this is due to centered content on the welcome
                                        # page. I dont wont such a big margins on the whole wite.
                                        # Maybe only on welcome page.
How site is feeling:
    Minimalistic and STRICT. On the welcome page can also be filled as free and infinite.
Colors i like:
    I like color color mixes
    Something on the dark back with colored elements.
    Look at color balance here: https://images.app.goo.gl/iD2QWNFfCtV3J8nm7
    You can make any other color balance, which is also dark.
