Timeline:
    How it works:
        Horizontal scroll.
        On the right is now.
        On the very left is first time I entered IT.
        First time I opern the page, I'm on the very right side.
        So I will scroll to left to see older things.
    How to find similar looks:
        You can google it with "progress timeline" or "timeline chart"
        https://images.app.goo.gl/fsDyr5pMwaNg8MU49
    What will be there:
        There will be displayed my work expirience and think I have learned or am learning.
        This can be tech skills like programming or Unix administration or other things like
        psychology, math, history and so on. Also there can be displayed my participations somewhere.
        For example, hackatons or seminariums and so on. Also there can be displayed my study progress
        in university. Also, my project can be there. So on, so on, so on...
    Functions:
        I can sort timeline elements by groups. For example, display only things, which are connected
        to the my job expirience, or only to tech skills or both and so on.
    How it looks like:
        A full window timeline horizontal chart, where are a lot of horizontal colored lines, with
        titles, which represents thing I was doing that moment.
        As the first my proposition, I would split timechart elelemnts on the following groups:
            - eduction
            - job
            - tech skill
                - frontend
                - backend
                - administration
                - math
                - ...
            - psychology
            - history
            - philosophy
            - languages
            - projects
            - ...
