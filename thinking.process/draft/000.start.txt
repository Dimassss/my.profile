Website:
    minimalistic but with a lot of space. Page must be filled as balanced as Chinise philosohy and deep as cold mountine or cyberpunk antiutopie
    hacker / tech / cyberpunk / any other style
    also you can give me your propositions about page profile style. It can be any other, even not tech
